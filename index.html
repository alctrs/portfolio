    <p>Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes? No... of course not. I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have. Master Yoda, you can't die. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. Then I am a Jedi? Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.</p>
